# C-lists_lib

## Description

This is one of my personal projects.
It's a library made to help managing linked lists in C language.
Functions are listed in the `include/lists.h` and each file is documented.

## Usage

To use this library: 
- add the `/include/C-lists.h` file to your project's include directory.
- add the `/list_lib` directory to your project's root.
- Add the .c files to your Makefile
- And voil√†! You can now manage your linked lists as you want

## Disclaimer

I started programming in October 2023 and all my projets are there to try new things, so feel free to address any issues you see or any improvements you think of.
